## Bug Fix Report

### 1. "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')" Error
**File:** supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity:** Critical

**Problem:** The Edge Function was crashing with a 500 error when trying to call .replace() on an undefined value.

**Solution:** Added additional type checking for personalizedContent to prevent the error:
```typescript
${personalizedContent && typeof personalizedContent === 'string' ? personalizedContent.replace(/\n/g, '<br>') : 'Welcome to our innovation community!'}
```

### 2. Incorrect OpenAI API Response Parsing
**File:** supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity:** High

**Problem:** Initially reported as using the wrong array index when parsing OpenAI API response, but upon code review, the correct index [0] was already being used:
```typescript
return data?.choices[0]?.message?.content;
```

**Solution:** No fixes were needed as the code was already correct.

### 3. Duplicate Edge Function Calls
**File:** src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity:** High

**Problem:** Edge Function send-confirmation was being called twice in the handleSubmit function.

**Solution:** Reorganized the form processing logic. Edge Function is now called only after successful database insertion.

### 4. Missing Error Handling in LeadStore
**File:** src/lib/lead-store.ts  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The Zustand store lacked proper error handling, validation, and loading states.

**Solution:** 
- Added loading state setting at the beginning and end of operations
- Improved input data validation
- Added email format validation
- Updated state after successful addition or in case of error

### 5. Missing Industry Field in Lead Interface
**File:** src/lib/lead-store.ts  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The Lead interface validation was missing the industry field check.

**Solution:** Added required industry field validation:
```typescript
if (!lead.name || !lead.email || !lead.industry) {
  throw new Error('Invalid lead data: name, email, and industry are required');
}
```

### 6. Critical Database Integration Missing
**File:** src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity:** Critical

**Problem:** The lead capture form was NOT saving leads to the Supabase database.

**Solution:** Added code to save leads to the Supabase database before sending email confirmation:
```typescript
const { error: dbError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .insert([{
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
    submitted_at: new Date().toISOString()
  }]);
```

### 7. Migration File Naming Convention Issue
**File:** supabase/migrations/  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** Supabase CLI was rejecting migration files due to incorrect naming convention:
```
Skipping migration 20250709162443-bdd6e132-6320-4844-9f9e-fc8663b59a0c.sql... 
(file name must match pattern "<timestamp>_name.sql")
```

**Solution:** Migration files were renamed to match the required format:
- 20250709162443-bdd6e132-6320-4844-9f9e-fc8663b59a0c.sql → 20250709162443_create_leads_table.sql
- 20250710135108-750b5b2b-27f7-4c84-88a0-9bd839f3be33.sql → 20250710135108_add_industry_column.sql

### Additional Fixes

### 8. State Inconsistency Between Components
**File:** src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The LeadCaptureForm component was using local state for `leads` and `submitted`, while SuccessMessage was using global store state. This could cause inconsistencies in the UI.

**Solution:** Removed duplicate state and used only the global Zustand store state:
```typescript
// Removed local state
const [leads, setLeads] = useState<Array<{ name: string; email: string; industry: string; submitted_at: string }>>([]);
const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

// Used global state instead
const { addLead, sessionLeads, submitted, setSubmitted, error: storeError, clearError, isLoading, setLoading } = useLeadStore();
```

### 9. Missing Network Error Handling
**File:** src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The form lacked proper network error handling and request timeouts, which could cause the UI to hang indefinitely if a request failed.

**Solution:** Added abort controllers with timeouts for both database and Edge Function calls:
```typescript
// Database request with timeout
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000); // 10 seconds timeout

const { error: dbError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .insert([/* data */])
  .abortSignal(controller.signal);
  
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```

### 10. Missing API Key Validation in Edge Function
**File:** supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity:** High

**Problem:** The Edge Function was using a fallback "invalid_key" when the environment variable was not set, which would lead to silent failures.

**Solution:** Added explicit check for API key presence and proper error response:
```typescript
if (!resendApiKey) {
  console.error("RESEND_PUBLIC_KEY is not set in environment variables");
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ error: "Email service configuration error" }),
    { status: 500, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", ...corsHeaders } }
  );
}
```

### 11. Insufficient Server-Side Validation
**File:** supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The Edge Function lacked proper input validation, relying only on client-side validation.

**Solution:** Added server-side validation for required fields and email format:
```typescript
// Server-side validation
if (!name || !email || !industry) {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ error: "Missing required fields" }),
    { status: 400, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", ...corsHeaders } }
  );
}

// Basic email validation
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid email format" }),
    { status: 400, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", ...corsHeaders } }
  );
}
```

### 12. Insecure CORS Configuration
**File:** supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The CORS configuration allowed requests from any origin (`"*"`) without restrictions, which could be a security risk in production.

**Solution:** Added environment-based CORS configuration:
```typescript
const corsHeaders = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": Deno.env.get("ENVIRONMENT") === "production" 
    ? "https://your-production-domain.com" 
    : "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type",
};
```

### 13. Missing Email Delivery Status Tracking
**File:** src/lib/lead-store.ts  
**Severity:** Low

**Problem:** The application didn't track whether the confirmation email was successfully sent.

**Solution:** Added `emailSent` field to the Lead interface and updated the store to track this information:
```typescript
export interface Lead {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  industry: string;
  submitted_at: string;
  emailSent?: boolean; // Optional flag to track if confirmation email was sent
}
```
